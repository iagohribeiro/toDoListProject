## Description

> This To-Do list was created in `C++` using `Qt 5.12`. 
With this To-Do list you can add tasks to a list by choosing a priority for the task. You can also edit the task by adding a background color.
If you add a task erroneously, you can delete it.
Finally, after finishing a task, you can mark it as done and leave it in the list in case you want to reuse it.



More information on how to use the To-Do list can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/iagohribeiro/toDoListProject/wiki) of this repository or through the links below:
